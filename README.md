## RANK & STAR SYSTEM :

1. There are 5 ranks `BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, DIAMOND, GOAT`
2. Every time you complete a round, `you will be given 1 star`
3. After collecting 5 stars, your rank will be increased and start with one star in next round`

## GENERAL RULES:

1. You have to `solve all questions in less than 4/5/6/7/8 seconds` based on your rank to be able to rank up
2. You have 5 chances to fail, chances will reset to 5 after 24 hours
3. If you failed with `score < 2 or your average time > 7/8/9/10/11 seconds`, you will be star down
4. Every time you fail, it will cost you 1 chance. The `GAME IS OVER if your chance become 0`
5. Copy your result and paste it to twitter or other social media ;) and tag me @agungdlgs
6. There are 5 simple math questions each round. Difficulty is based on your rank and star. 
    example SILVER rank:
    
        2 + 3 - 4
    
    example DIAMOND rank:
    
        2 + 3 - 4 * 3 / 9
        
7. if there is decimal answer because of divison operator, round it to the bottom unit. for example:
        
        2 + 3 - 4 * 3 / 9
        
    answer is 3 not 3.66667
        
        2/4 - 5
        
    answer is -5 not -4.5`
